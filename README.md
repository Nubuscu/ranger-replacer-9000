### how to run it and stuff

##### setup
go to the discord website and make yourself an app [here](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me)

click on "create a bot user" and reveal the token. this is yours, keep it secret but put it in the config.json so you can use it. 
Then, you'll probably want to generate an oauth2 url and add the bot to your server. once there, 
right click on a channel and copy it's ID and add that to the config.json as well

##### usage
Install Node.js if you haven't already. Once that's done, navigate to the root directory of the repo and type `npm install` in console. After that, `node app.js` should set things going.
bear in mind that the post frequency is 12 hours, so change the number at the bottom of app.js if you want to change that

### was that confusing?

google is your friend :)
